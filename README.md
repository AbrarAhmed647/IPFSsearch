# IPFSFinder
IPFSFinder is a centralized search engine for decentralized peer-peer Inter-Planetary File System(IPFS) that uses KEYWORDS that are easy for humans to remember instead of CID (the traditional way of searching through IPFS network) to search through the IPFS network for a file

__Drawbacks of searching across the network using CID only:__
1. Can only search for content with known CID (its like using ipaddresses instead of URLs, which is bad)
2. Not suitable for all application scenarios
3. Requires hosting an IPFS node
4. Slower data manipulation and latency in data retrieval because the search is decentralized


Why choose IPFS?- We chose IPFS because it has more extensive documentation and a larger user base

Our solution which is built from scratch eliminates all the mentioned drawbacks and leverages the centralization search advantages like GoogleSE.
